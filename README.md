## Features

- Interactive Camera: Control the camera to explore planets, fly through asteroid belts, and orbit around celestial bodies.

- Realistic Texturing and Lighting: Uses OpenGL shaders to provide realistic lighting effects and detailed textures.

- Audio Integration: Background music enhances this immersive experience.

- Asteroid Belt and Planets: Asteroids Belt and Planets have been modeled and positioned in order to reproduce the Solar System as accurately as possible.
